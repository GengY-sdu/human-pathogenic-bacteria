# Anthropogenic activity and climate change exacerbate the spread of pathogenic bacteria in the environment

## Introduction

This project includes all R code used for analyzing machine learning and climate change.

Please place these files in a folder named `pathogen` and set default working directory of R to the previous level of the `pathogen`. For example, if the path of `pathogen` is `a/b/c/pthogen`, execute the command `setwd(dir = "a/b/c/")` in R.

## Detailed description

-   The `map_spatial` folder contains scripts for pridicting the global distribution of human pathogenic bacteria **richness** by spliting dataset through spatial isolation.
-   The `map_spatial_abun` folder contains scripts for pridicting the global distribution of human pathogenic bacteria **abundance** by spliting dataset through spatial isolation.
-   The `map_spatial_cv` folder contains scripts for pridicting the global distribution of human pathogenic bacteria by spliting dataset through spatial isolation.
-   The `map_spatial_cv_abun` folder contains scripts for pridicting the global distribution of human pathogenic bacteria by spliting dataset through spatial isolation.
-   The `future_spatial` folder contains scripts for pridicting the global distribution of human pathogenic bacteria by spliting dataset through spatial isolation.
